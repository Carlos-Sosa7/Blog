Hello everyone! My name is Carlos Sosa. Glad you took the time to stop by my blog. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela but have lived in Miami, Florida since July 2007. I am in incoming sophomore at the University of Michigan planning on studying Information Science or Data Science. I am currently studying abroad in Lisbon on a program called I_Xperience.
